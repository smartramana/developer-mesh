  - REST API endpoints for API key CRUD operations
    - `POST /api/v1/api-keys` - Create additional API keys after registration
    - `GET /api/v1/api-keys` - List all keys with usage statistics (usage_count, last_used_at, rate_limit)
    - `DELETE /api/v1/api-keys/:id` - Revoke keys when compromised or no longer needed
  - Fix base64 encoding issue: use RawURLEncoding to remove padding characters
  - Complete audit trail for all credential operations

- **Personal Access Token Storage** (commit 2fb6b4de)
  - Secure credential storage for 11+ external services (GitHub, Harness, Jira, GitLab, Bitbucket, Jenkins, SonarQube, Artifactory, etc.)
  - User credential middleware for automatic token loading during MCP tool calls
  - AES-256-GCM encryption with per-tenant keys
  - Three-tier credential priority system: user DB → passthrough → service account
  - Credential validation endpoints with metadata and scope support

    - **Harness**: Module-based filtering (pipeline, gitops, ccm, sto, etc.)
    - **GitLab, Bitbucket, Jira, Slack**: Provider-specific permission discovery
  - Operations filtered based on discovered permissions with 24-hour cache
  - Permissions stored in `user_credentials.metadata` per user rather than organization-wide

#### Context Embedding Worker Implementation

- **Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup**
  - Moved embedding factory from REST API to shared package for worker access
  - Fixed table name bugs in context repository (context_embedding_links → context_embeddings)
  - Created `pkg/embedding/factory.go` with `CreateEmbeddingServiceV2()`
  - Added `EmbeddingCacheAdapter` for embedding result caching
  - Established foundation for async embedding generation

- **Phase 2: Event Publishing**
  - Integrated queue client into REST API for event publishing
  - Context updates now publish 'context.items.created' events to Redis Streams
  - Events include context_id, tenant_id, agent_id, and embeddable items
  - Graceful degradation when Redis unavailable (logs warnings, continues operation)
  - Only user/assistant messages trigger embedding generation
  - Filters out system messages and non-embeddable content

- **Phase 3: Worker Processing**

  - Replaced ON CONFLICT upsert with atomic DELETE+INSERT transaction pattern
  - Fixed in three implementations:
    1. `pkg/repository/context_repository_postgres.go` - LinkEmbeddingToContext (primary fix)
    2. `pkg/repository/vector/repository.go` - StoreContextEmbedding
    3. `pkg/repository/embedding_repository.go` - StoreContextEmbedding
  - Benefits: Eliminates constraint matching complexity, provides explicit transaction control
  - Testing: Verified end-to-end with context 88603826-d042-4435-a21d-48ddfedb85cb
  - Result: Complete embedding generation and linking workflow operational

- **Fixed Worker Cache Initialization**
  - Worker was passing nil cache to embedding service causing nil pointer panics
  - Properly initialize Redis cache client from existing connection

  - Added graceful fallback if cache initialization fails
  - Result: Worker successfully processes embedding events without crashes

- **Fixed Context UUID Handling**
  - Corrected UUID parsing and validation in context creation
  - Fixed context_id field type mismatches across services
  - Ensured consistent UUID format in database and API responses

- **Webhook Processing** (partially working):
  - Redis streams configured and working
  - GitHub webhooks can be received
  - Processing logic incomplete

### Working Authentication
- **Simple API Key Auth**: 
  - Static API keys in configuration working
  - Bearer token validation for REST API
  - Basic auth for tool credentials

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Required for Operation**:
  - PostgreSQL 14+ (for tool configs)
  - Redis 7+ (for queues and caching)
  - Go 1.21+ for building
  
- **Optional/Unused**:
  - AWS Bedrock (embedding models not used)
  - S3 (context storage not implemented)
  - pgvector extension (installed but not utilized)

### Testing Coverage
- REST API endpoints have basic tests
- MCP protocol has test scripts
- Dynamic tools have integration tests
- Edge MCP tested with Claude Code

### Known Issues & Limitations
- Semantic search returns empty results (TODO in code)
- Multi-agent orchestration not connected
- Email service not implemented
- Context storage to S3 not working
- Embedding generation disabled
- Vector database tables empty
- Organization registration flow incomplete

### What Actually Works
1. **Tool Discovery**: Point at any OpenAPI spec, it discovers and registers tools
2. **Tool Execution**: Execute any registered tool via MCP or REST API
3. **Claude Code Integration**: Edge MCP works seamlessly with Claude Code
4. **GitHub Tools**: All 41 GitHub API endpoints working through dynamic tools
5. **Health Monitoring**: Automatic health checks for all registered tools
6. **Minimal Context**: InputSchema generation keeps token usage low

### What Doesn't Work
1. **Semantic Search**: Code exists but always returns empty
2. **Embeddings**: Full infrastructure built but never generates vectors
3. **Multi-Agent**: Tables exist but no orchestration logic
4. **Workflows**: Schema defined but execution not implemented
5. **Context Storage**: S3 integration not connected
- Embedding API conditionally registered based on provider availability

## Notes

This is the initial release of Developer Mesh, providing a production-ready platform for orchestrating AI agents in DevOps workflows. The platform implements the industry-standard Model Context Protocol (MCP) and provides comprehensive multi-tenant support with enterprise-grade security features.
