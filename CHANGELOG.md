## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **GitHub Response Optimization for MCP Tools** (2025-09-18): Dramatically reduced response sizes to prevent context exhaustion
  - Implemented selective field filtering for all high-volume GitHub handlers
  - Created response_utils.go with simplification functions for workflow runs, pull requests, issues, commits, repositories, and code search results
  - Reduced response sizes by 90-97%: list_workflow_runs from ~17,800 to ~500 tokens (97% reduction)
  - Optimized handlers: ListWorkflows, ListWorkflowRuns, ListPullRequests, ListIssues, ListCommits, SearchRepositories, SearchCode, SearchIssues
  - Preserved all essential fields while removing redundant nested objects (duplicate repository/user objects)
  - Truncated long text fields (commit messages, bodies) to 200-500 characters
  - Result: Can now fetch 20x more data before hitting MCP context limits, significantly improving AI agent efficiency

### Fixed

- **Critical GitHub Provider Parameter and Pagination Issues** (2025-09-17): Resolved parameter passing and pagination problems
  - Fixed double-nesting of parameters when MCP passes them to REST API
  - MCP was sending correctly structured params, but REST API client was wrapping them again
  - Enhanced extractInt() helper to handle multiple types (float64, int, int64, string)
  - Fixed ExtractPagination() to check for both 'per_page' (snake_case) and 'perPage' (camelCase)
  - Updated all search handlers to use robust extractInt() instead of direct type assertion
  - Added proper pagination defaults (per_page=30) and validation (max=100)
  - Added comprehensive logging to trace parameter flow for debugging
  - Result: All GitHub operations now working correctly with proper pagination support
  - Affected handlers: SearchIssues, SearchRepositories, SearchCode, SearchPullRequests, ListIssues

- **SSRF Vulnerabilities in Discovery Service** (2025-09-10): Fixed CodeQL security alerts
  - Resolved 5 "Uncontrolled data used in network request" (SSRF) alerts
  - Changed URL validation approach from conditional to always validate
  - Configure validator with AllowLocalhost=true for test mode compatibility
  - Affected files: discovery_service.go (3 alerts), discovery_hints.go (2 alerts)
  - Result: All SSRF alerts resolved while maintaining test functionality

- **Code Quality and Linting Issues** (2025-09-08): Resolved all golangci-lint errors across the codebase
  - Fixed 8 errcheck errors: Added proper error handling for JSON encode/decode operations and HTTP writes
  - Fixed 7 staticcheck issues: Removed unnecessary nil checks, applied De Morgan's law, removed embedded field selectors
  - Converted if-else chains to switch statements for better readability (QF1003)
  - Affected files: enhanced_tool_registry.go, gitlab tests, artifactory provider, harness provider and tests
  - Result: 0 linting issues remaining (was 15)

- **Harness Provider Authentication and Parameter Handling** (2025-09-08): Fixed multiple issues with Harness integration
  - Fixed credential mapping: Changed from always setting "token" to proper key mapping based on auth type (api_key vs bearer)
  - Added automatic accountIdentifier extraction from PAT token format (pat.ACCOUNT_ID.xxx)
  - Added default parameter substitution for missing org/project parameters ("default" fallback)
  - Fixed STO vulnerabilities endpoint path from `/sto/api/v2/vulnerabilities` to `/sto/api/v2/issues`
  - Improved error handling for non-JSON responses (HTML error pages)
  - Added special request body handling for CCM endpoints that expect filter objects
  - Fixed query parameter handling for POST requests that require query params
  - Results: 5 Harness tools now working (was 0), 7 return expected auth/project errors

- **Operation Name Transformation for GitHub Actions** (2025-09-05): Fixed incorrect operation ID transformation
  - Resolved issue where GitHub Actions operations were being over-transformed
  - Changed tool ID generation to use hyphens consistently instead of mix of underscores/hyphens
  - Fixed aggressive hyphen-to-slash replacement in OperationResolver fuzzy matching
  - Updated GitHub provider to handle multi-hyphen operations intelligently
  - Operations like 'actions-list-repo-workflows' now correctly map to 'actions/list-repo-workflows'
    instead of incorrectly transforming to 'actions/list/repo/workflows'
  - Implemented smart replacement strategy based on hyphen count:
    - Single hyphen: full replacement (e.g., 'repos-get' → 'repos/get')
    - Multiple hyphens: first hyphen only (e.g., 'actions-list-repo-workflows' → 'actions/list-repo-workflows')
  - Root cause: Multiple layers were doing blanket string replacements without coordination

### Added

- **Template-Based Tool Expansion for All Providers** (2025-08-29): Universal tool expansion system
  - Implemented generic template-based tool expansion in DynamicToolsAPI
  - Removed all hardcoded provider checks (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Harness)

- **Docker Compose**: Full local development environment

### Planned but NOT Implemented

#### Features Built but Inactive
- **Vector Database / Semantic Search**:
  - pgvector tables and indexes created but empty
  - Embedding API endpoints return empty results
  - No actual embeddings being generated or stored
  - Semantic search is TODO in code
  - ~30% of codebase dedicated to unused vector features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**:
  - Agent tables exist but not populated
  - Task delegation logic not implemented
  - Workflow execution not connected

- **Embedding Models**:
  - Model catalog structure exists
  - Provider integrations coded but not used
  - Cost tracking tables empty
  - No actual embedding generation occurring

- **Authentication System** (tables exist, not fully implemented):
  - Organization and user tables created
  - JWT token structure defined
  - Session management tables present

- **Webhook Processing** (partially working):
  - Redis streams configured and working
  - GitHub webhooks can be received
  - Processing logic incomplete

### Working Authentication
- **Simple API Key Auth**: 
  - Static API keys in configuration working
  - Bearer token validation for REST API
  - Basic auth for tool credentials

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Required for Operation**:
  - PostgreSQL 14+ (for tool configs)
  - Redis 7+ (for queues and caching)
  - Go 1.21+ for building
  
- **Optional/Unused**:
  - AWS Bedrock (embedding models not used)
  - S3 (context storage not implemented)
  - pgvector extension (installed but not utilized)

### Testing Coverage
- REST API endpoints have basic tests
- MCP protocol has test scripts
- Dynamic tools have integration tests
- Edge MCP tested with Claude Code

### Known Issues & Limitations
- Semantic search returns empty results (TODO in code)
- Multi-agent orchestration not connected
- Email service not implemented
- Context storage to S3 not working
- Embedding generation disabled
- Vector database tables empty
- Organization registration flow incomplete

### What Actually Works
1. **Tool Discovery**: Point at any OpenAPI spec, it discovers and registers tools
2. **Tool Execution**: Execute any registered tool via MCP or REST API
3. **Claude Code Integration**: Edge MCP works seamlessly with Claude Code
4. **GitHub Tools**: All 41 GitHub API endpoints working through dynamic tools
5. **Health Monitoring**: Automatic health checks for all registered tools
6. **Minimal Context**: InputSchema generation keeps token usage low

### What Doesn't Work
1. **Semantic Search**: Code exists but always returns empty
2. **Embeddings**: Full infrastructure built but never generates vectors
3. **Multi-Agent**: Tables exist but no orchestration logic
4. **Workflows**: Schema defined but execution not implemented
5. **Context Storage**: S3 integration not connected
- Embedding API conditionally registered based on provider availability
