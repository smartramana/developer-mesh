# Worker Docker Configuration
# This provides app-specific overrides for the Worker when running in Docker
# It inherits from the main docker configuration

# Use the main docker configuration as base
_base: ../../configs/config.docker.yaml

# Worker specific settings
api:
  service_name: "worker"
  # Worker doesn't need HTTP server
  listen_address: ""
  
# Worker-specific configuration
worker:
  # Override concurrency for worker
  concurrency: ${WORKER_CONCURRENCY:-10}
  
  # Worker-specific queue settings
  sqs:
    visibility_timeout: 300s  # 5 minutes
    wait_time_seconds: 20     # Long polling
    
# Any Worker-specific overrides can go here
# Most configuration should be in the shared config.docker.yaml
