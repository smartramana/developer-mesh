# GitHub App Setup for Integration Testing

âœ… **VERIFIED**: This setup is required for the actual GitHub integration tests in `test/github-live/`.

## Finding Your GitHub App Installation ID

After installing your GitHub App on a repository, you need the installation ID for authentication.

### Method 1: Via GitHub UI
1. Go to your GitHub App settings: https://github.com/settings/apps/YOUR_APP_NAME
2. Click on "Install App" in the sidebar
3. You'll see your installations listed
4. Click on the installation (e.g., your username or organization)
5. Look at the URL - it will be something like:
   `https://github.com/settings/installations/12345678`
   The number at the end (12345678) is your installation ID

### Method 2: Via API (if you have a Personal Access Token)
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PAT" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/app/installations
```

### Method 3: Via GitHub CLI
```bash
gh api /app/installations --jq '.[].id'
```

## Update Your .env.test

Once you have the installation ID, update your `.env.test` with all required values:

```bash
# GitHub App Configuration (REQUIRED for tests)
GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/path/to/private-key.pem
GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID=12345678

# Test Repository (REQUIRED)
GITHUB_TEST_ORG=your-org-or-username
GITHUB_TEST_REPO=test-repo

# Disable mocking
USE_GITHUB_MOCK=false
```

## Common Issues

### "Not Found (INVALID_CREDENTIALS)"
This error typically means:
1. The App ID is incorrect
2. The private key doesn't match the App
3. The App isn't installed on the repository
4. The installation ID is missing or incorrect

### Verifying Your Setup
1. Check that your App ID matches what's shown in GitHub
2. Ensure the private key file was downloaded from the same App
3. Verify the App is installed on your test repository
4. Confirm the installation ID is correct

## Testing Authentication

### Verify Your Setup
There's a dedicated test to verify your GitHub App installation:

```bash
# Run installation verification
USE_GITHUB_MOCK=false go test -v -tags=github_live ./test/github-live -run TestVerifyGitHubAppInstallation
```

### Run Full Test Suite
```bash
# Using the test script
./scripts/test-github-integration.sh

# Or directly with proper build tag
USE_GITHUB_MOCK=false go test -v -tags=github_live ./test/github-live
