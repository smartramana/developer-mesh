# MCP Agent SDK Guide

> **Purpose**: Information about the MCP Agent SDK
> **Status**: No SDK Currently Available
> **Last Updated**: January 2025

## Current Status

The DevOps MCP project **does not currently provide an official Agent SDK**. This guide serves as a placeholder and reference for future SDK development.

## Current Agent Development Approach

Without an official SDK, agents must be developed using standard WebSocket libraries and following the patterns demonstrated in the project's test implementations.

### Reference Implementations

The best current references for agent development are:

1. **Test Agent Implementation**: `/test/e2e/agent/agent.go`
   - Shows WebSocket connection setup
   - Demonstrates proper authentication
   - Includes message handling patterns
   - Implements binary protocol support

2. **WebSocket Client Requirements**: `/docs/WEBSOCKET_CLIENT_REQUIREMENTS.md`
   - Critical subprotocol requirements (`mcp.v1`)
   - Authentication patterns
   - Error handling

3. **Agent Registration Guide**: `/docs/guides/agent-registration-guide.md`
   - Step-by-step connection process
   - Message protocol examples
   - Troubleshooting tips

## Required Libraries

For Go development, agents currently use:
- `github.com/coder/websocket` - WebSocket client library
- Standard Go libraries for JSON encoding/decoding
- Custom protocol implementation based on test examples

## Future SDK Plans

An official SDK would potentially provide:

### Core Features
- Simplified agent creation and lifecycle management
- Automatic WebSocket connection handling with reconnection
- Type-safe message definitions
- Built-in error handling and retry logic
- Task processing framework
- Capability management
- State synchronization

### Potential SDK Structure
```
sdk/
├── agent/           # Core agent implementation
├── client/          # WebSocket client wrapper
├── protocol/        # Message protocol definitions
├── tasks/           # Task handling framework
├── capabilities/    # Capability definitions
└── examples/        # Example agents
```

### Desired API Design
```go
// Hypothetical future SDK API
agent := sdk.NewAgent("my-agent", []string{"code_analysis"})
agent.OnTask(handleTask)
agent.Connect("wss://mcp.dev-mesh.io/ws", apiKey)
agent.Start(ctx)
```

## Contributing to SDK Development

If you're interested in contributing to SDK development:

1. Review existing test implementations
2. Identify common patterns that could be abstracted
3. Consider cross-language support requirements
4. Propose designs in project discussions

## Current Best Practices

Until an SDK is available:

1. **Use Test Agent as Template**: Copy and modify `/test/e2e/agent/agent.go`
2. **Follow Protocol Requirements**: Always include `mcp.v1` subprotocol
3. **Handle Reconnection**: Implement automatic reconnection logic
4. **Implement Heartbeat**: Respond to ping messages
5. **Use Proper Libraries**: `github.com/coder/websocket` for Go

## Alternative Approaches

### Community SDKs
The community may develop unofficial SDKs. Check:
- Project discussions and issues
- Community forums
- Third-party repositories

### Code Generation
Consider using the test agent as a basis for code generation tools that could scaffold new agents.
